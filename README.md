# Introduction

This repository holds modules for [Willie](https://github.com/embolalia/willie), they are no longer being developed and archived here for reference.

# Instructions

The easiest way to install these is to put them in ``~/.willie/modules``, and
then add ``extra = /home/yourname/.willie/modules`` to the ``[core]`` section of
your config file.

If any one module has further instructions, there will (probably) be a file
named something like ``modulename-README.md`` to detail them.
